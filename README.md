# Electricity-Billing
Electricity billing is the process of calculating and charging customers for their electricity usage over a specific period.
# 🔌 Electricity Billing System (C++ Project)

## 👨‍💻 About the Project
This is a simple **Electricity Billing System** created using **C++** as part of my 1st year **BCA (Bachelor of Computer Applications)** coursework. The project allows users to calculate electricity bills based on units consumed.

## 🧾 Features
- Input customer details (Name, Customer ID, Units consumed)
- Calculate bill based on unit slabs
- Display the final bill

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Programming Language: **C++**
- IDE: Any C++ compiler (e.g., Turbo C++, Code::Blocks, Dev C++, VS Code with MinGW)

## 📋 How It Works
1. The user enters customer details.
2. The program calculates the bill using fixed rates per unit.
3. The final bill is displayed on the screen.

## 📌 Sample Rate Chart (Example)
| Units Consumed | Rate per Unit |
|----------------|----------------|
| 0 - 100        | ₹1.5           |
| 101 - 300      | ₹2.5           |
| Above 300      | ₹4.0           |

*(You can update this rate chart as per your logic in the code.)*

## 📂 Files Included
- `main.cpp` - Main source code file
- `README.md` - Project documentation (this file)

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Open the code in your C++ IDE or text editor.
2. Compile the code.
3. Run the program.
4. Follow on-screen instructions.
